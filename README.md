## About
While most music players provide an option for Internet streaming, you might not always want to run your resource hungry media player.

Radiola is a lightweight Internet radio player for macOS, it's located in the status bar and allows you to listen to Internet radio stations quickly and without complications.

Most often, you use the **menu in the status bar**.

In the **station window** you can both manage the station list and use it as an Internet radio player.
